# Bonus

What I've added to the initial test :
- Universal app : iPhone and iPad for the same binary
- Localization fr + en
- Cell selected background color and user detail background color may change : it depends on the gender of the selected user.
- All interface orientation : portrait and landscape 
- You can add a facebook user with the "+" button in the contact list. Then you have just to type a facebook id.
- You can remove a contact from your list
- All images are loading in background
